    "This analysis uses a dataset categorizing patients with a cardiovascular disease diagnosis.  It contains a collection of 11 attributes that were gathered with the intention of trying to identify potential characteristics of individuals that correlate with heart disease. The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the data through statistical summaries and visualization to elucidate any trends that will be useful for building a prediction model for classifying a patient as having a cardiovascular disease diagnosis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was procured from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset) but it is unclear from where the original data originates. However, the features are described well enough to understand what each of them represents. In a practical \"real-world\" setting, verifying the source of this data and scrutinizing the methods of its collection would be a vital part of the analysis, but for the purposes of our academic interests in data visualization and eventual prediction modelling, this level of validity is inconsequential as long as the data has realistic characteristics and application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of any prediction algorithm using this data is to determine if any of these attributes or combination of them can predict a cardiovascular disease diagnosis. These predicition models could provide valuable insight into what conditions or behaviors might be correlated with heart disease and could be used in aiding diagnosis or helping to mitigate the disease through understanding its possible causes. Many of the attributes collected are based on long standing suppositions of conditions or behaviors associated with heart disease like high cholesterol, smoking, or alcohol consumption. This analysis and subsequent prediction modelling can hopefully identify if any of these are more associated with (or even perhaps falsely attributed to) a diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of a prediction model for classifying patients could be measured in several ways depending on the implementation. For example, the intent of the model could be to identify individuals likely to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease so they can be given an objective reason to make behavioral changes to reduce their chances of a future diagnosis. In this case, maximizing sensitivity at the expense of accuracy and specificity might be the best option because there would be few downsides to making false positive classifications. On the other hand, if something like high cholesterol was found to be a highly significant predictor and there was a decision to be made about prescribing a drug that could have side effects for the patient, accuracy and a more balanced sensitivity and specificity might be more important as false positives become more of a concern. For reasons like these, a few different prediction models might be warranted for different specific uses. \n",

For example, we would likely assume blood pressure measurements will be reasonably accurate as they were taken by a trained health professional, but should be wary of a patient's proclivity to be honest when asked whether they are a regular smoker or drinker."
