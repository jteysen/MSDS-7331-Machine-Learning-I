    "This analysis uses a dataset categorizing patients with a cardiovascular disease diagnosis.  It contains a collection of 11 attributes that were gathered with the intention of trying to identify potential characteristics of individuals that correlate with heart disease.\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal of any prediction algorithm using this data is to determine if any of these attributes or combination of them can accurately predict a cardiovascular disease diagnosis. These predicition models could provide valuable insight into what conditions or behaviors might be correlated with heart disease and could be used in aiding diagnosis or helping to mitigate the disease through understanding its possible causes.\n",

    "* *Examination*: Information resulting from medical examination;\n",
    "* *Subjective*: Information given by the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinctions between the different attributes are paramount to interpreting and qualifying results of analysis and modelling of this data as they can represent varying degrees of validity and potential biases, so it is important that we keep this in mind as we explore the data and eventually make any recommendations.\n",
